# The Lab

This is where we push the boundaries on Algorand projects!

## AlgoPost

An experimental framework to store tiny images on the Algorand Blockchain. Images are converted to 30 x 30 8 bit color pixel arrays (900 bytes) for storing in the Algorand blockchain "note" field. This is a cornerstone of our future planned Algorand-based resilient social media platform that will completely negate the need for 3rd party centralized databases and servers. Next on the list: using AI to upscale the tiny images client-side (i.e., with 255 principle component expansion filters).
