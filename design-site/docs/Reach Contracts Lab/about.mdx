# Overview

The Pipeline Reach Lab is an online tool to experiment with deploying and using TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Lanuage) smart contracts that have been created with the Reach language.

Check out the [VIDEO](../Videos) to see it in action!

:::

## Get started

- • Select your net (for security reasons, the demo only allows the selection of testnet. You can enable mainnet by forking our github repository and adding MainNet to the network `<Select>` element)

- • Navigate to your MyAlgo wallet and set your wallet to testnet using their dropdown menu.

- • Fund your wallet via the link provided in the Demo

- • Select either a Reach or TEAL contract using demo's the dropdown menus. 

:::tip

The demo's `log` window will only log messages provided by the Reach "frontend" code or transaction id's for TEAL-only deploys. We recommend that at this point the user open their browser console log by right-clicking on the screen, hitting `inspect` and selecting the `console` option.

- • For all Reach contracts (except `Morra Game`), clicking `Deploy and Run Reach` will both deploy the smart contract and run the frontend and "backend" code associated with the Reach example, using your own connected addess to run the code for all participants.

- • A key feature of our implementation of the `Morra Game` is to demonstrate how Reach code can be utilized without any RPC servers or backends needed. Identical code exists on all client machines and runs entirely client-side (with the exception of the smart contract), with participants merely inputing the app id of the Morra Game smart contract. 

- • The Morra Game must be played with two seperate addresses (documented below)


## Morra Game

Selecting the `Reach Morra Game` will display a dropdown to select a role and an input for an app id.

- • To run the game, 2 users load the demo on seperate machines and connect their seperate accounts. The user who will deploy the contract and act as participant `Alice` selects the `Deployer & Participant` role and clicks `Deploy & Run Reach`.

- • Immediately after deploying the contract, `Alice` must locate the app id on AlgoExplorer and share it with user `Bob`.

- • User `Bob` inputs the app id, selects the `Participant` role and clicks `Deploy & Run Reach`.

- • At this point, the Reach code automatically generates the bets and guesses for both participants, only requiring that the transactions be signed in the MyAlgo popup windows.

- • If the smart contract obverves a winner, the winner will receive the amount wagered by the loser.

- • In the event of either a winner or timeout, the Reach code will automatically prompt user `Alice` to delete the app.

## Adapting Reach Code

The code examples provided in the ReachLang github examples folder can be utilized in serverless online apps via the following process: 

- • Clone the repo and compile the Reach code following the instructions provided on the Reach doc site

- • Copy the "backend" code from the created `build` folder and import it into your main JavaScript or React file (app.js or index.js)

- • Copy the "frontend" code (index.mjs from parent folder) and paste or import it into your main file. 

- • replace the following line wherever it occurs with a variable that contains an Algorand address as string:

```jsx
await stdlib.newTestAccount(startingBalance);
```

- • Locate the code that begins at: 

```jsx
await Promise.all([
```

- • Copy this entire block and rewrite it to conditionaly run only the segment corresponding to the role that the client selects. 

- • Replace the `getInfo()` function call with `parseInt(appId)` and set `appId` to the id of the smart contract

- • Replace `ldstdlib` call with:

```jsx
const stdlib = loadStdlib('ALGO')`
```

Finally, the following code must be run before the Reach frontend code:

```jsx
stdlib.setWalletFallback(stdlib.walletFallback({
    providerEnv: net, MyAlgoConnect
}));

stdlib.getDefaultAccount().then(
    response => {
        acct = response.networkAccount.addr;
    }
)
```
