### Install the library:

cd myNewApp
npm install pipeline-ui
```
### Import components into your React project:

```jsx
import { AlgoButton, AlgoSendButton, Pipeline} from 'pipeline-ui';
```

### Modifying the library:

If you wish to download and modify the library components via source code, run the following code to save it to your user root directory and install its dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/headline-design/pipeline-ui
cd pipeline-ui
npm install
```

You may then edit the components via the index.js file found inside each component folder in the parent folder /src. After saving changes, you must then run the following code from the pipeline-ui parent folder:
```bash
npm run build
npm pack
```

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
